      It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:
    </div>
    <div id="middle">
      "The messenger of Allah said:
      There has come to you Ramadan,a blessed month,
      which Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has enjoined
      you to fast. In it the gates of heavens are opened
      and the gates of hell are closed, and every devil
      is chained up. In it Allah has a night which is
      better than a thousand months; whoever is deprived
      of it's goodness is indeed deprived."
